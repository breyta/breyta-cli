# Core concepts
- Flow definition: a versioned EDN map that describes triggers, steps, and orchestration.
- End-user flow: a flow intended to be installed/used by non-creators, marked with the `:end-user` tag (MVP).
- Installation: a per-user instance of an end-user flow. Implemented as a prod flow profile scoped to the current user.
- Flow profile: runtime configuration (bindings + activation inputs + enabled state) for a flow. For installations, this is user-scoped.
- Bindings: apply `:requires` slots and activation inputs (form values) for draft or prod.
- Activation: enables the prod profile after bindings are set; `--version` pins which version to run and does not accept inputs.
- Draft vs deployed: draft runs use draft bindings and draft version; deploy publishes an immutable version, activate enables prod.
- Triggers: manual, schedule, or event/webhook start a run.
- Versioning: deploy publishes a version; runs are pinned to the version that started them.
- Polling: `flow/poll` is a deterministic helper that expands to a loop + sleep, bounded by `:timeout` or `:max-attempts`.
