# Patterns and do/dont
## Activation and bindings flow
- Declare `:requires` in the flow definition.
- Apply bindings with a profile file to bind slots and provide activation inputs.
- Enable prod profile with `flows activate --version latest` (enable-only, idempotent).
- Use draft bindings for draft runs.

## Template usage
- Put large payloads in `:templates`.
- Reference with `:template` and `:data` to keep steps readable.

## Draft vs deploy
- `flows push` creates a draft.
- `flows deploy` publishes the draft and updates trigger routing.

## Do
- Keep flow body deterministic.
- Use `:function` steps for transforms.
- Include a manual trigger for discoverability.
- Use connection slots for credentials.

## Dont
- Hardcode secrets in steps.
- Use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` in flow body.
- Call nondeterministic functions in flow body.
